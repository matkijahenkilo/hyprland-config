This accursed hyprland session uses the following programs:

```
swaylock swayidle hyprpaper mako waybar wpctl brightnessctl wlogout slurp mpv sway-audio-idle-inhibit
```

I encountered many problems using XDPH-git, it seems better to use both XDPH and XDPW

```
xdg-desktop-portal xdg-desktop-portal-{hyprland,gtk,wlr}
```


*And many others!*

`git clone https://github.com/matkijahenkilo/hyprland-config ~/.config/hypr/`

To make scripts into executables

`chmod +x ~/.config/hypr/scripts/*`

TODO: become even more based and make it a Nix flake
